# Welcome

## Wecome is a networking app that helps expats navigate their new home environments

## Introduction

This app was created in two weeks during the Le Wagon Berlin bootcamp. It is built with Ruby on Rails using a Postgres database. The frontend uses the bootstrap framework and Sass. It was created by a team of 4 Le Wagon Students as the final project. Users can sign up to the app to access articles on the topic of living abroad and book mentors to help advise them on a variety of problems.

## App Features

## App Description

Users can sign up or sign in to see all the material on offer on the Welcome app. There are two main components of the app, first the article section which has a selection of articles written by mentors who work at Welcome. Users can read these articles on different topics such as how to submit taxes, bringing your pet from your home country, finding a flat, etc. If a user finds the article particularly helpful or interesting, the user can connect right away with the mentor who wrote it and see their profile. Each of the mentors specialize in different topics depending on their own background. Users can then book mentors for an advisor session to get advise and help resolving any issues they are facing as they move (or after they have moved) to a new country. They can also use the built in chat feature to ask questions immediately.

## App Improvements

While the app functions well, it still has room for improvement, particularly in the following areas:

- Make the design responsive
- Account for availablity when doing bookings
- Add unit tests
- Improve search bar
- Make more material accessible to the user before signing in
